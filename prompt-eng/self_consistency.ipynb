    "# Self Consistency Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the more advanced techniques in prompt engineering is self-consistency, introduced by `Wang et al. (2022)`. \n",
    "\n",
    "This method seeks to improve upon the traditional greedy decoding typically used in chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. \n",
    "\n",
    "The core concept involves sampling multiple diverse reasoning paths through few-shot CoT and leveraging these variations to determine the most consistent answer. The technique  enhances the effectiveness of CoT prompting, particularly for tasks requiring arithmetic and commonsense reasoning.\n",
